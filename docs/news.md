*New features released!*
- Various annotations associated with database records are now retrievable from the results table. Some annotations, such as transcript flags, are available for filtering the results. The available annotations can be found in the ANNOTATIONS section under the DATASETS tab and will be expanded in future.
- The destination URL format for converted IDs is now selectable.
- The process for converting gene symbols to NCBI Gene IDs in the LABEL2ID tab has been significantly improved in speed.
- Several minor improvements and bug fixes have also been implemented.

# 2024-12-05
- The dataset `uniprot_reference_proteome` has been renamed to `uniprot_proteome`, because this dataset includes proteomes other than the reference proteomes. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

# 2024-10-28
- The documentation has been updated. Please see the DOCUMENTS tab to learn about TogoID's features including recent developments.

# 2024-09-30
