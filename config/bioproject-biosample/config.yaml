  description: "The relationship between BioSample and BioProject is derived from the XML files provided by BioSample (biosample_set.xml) and BioProject (bioproject.xml). However, these files do not comprehensively cover all relations. If you are unable to find direct relations between your input BioSample/BioProject IDs and the corresponding BioProject/BioSample IDs, please consider using the path via SRA Experiment IDs, which may contains expected relations."
